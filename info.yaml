# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  author:       "Tholin"      # Your name
  title:        "Avalon Semiconductors 'TBB1143' Programmable Sound Generator"      # Project title
  description:  "Sound generator with two basic, square-wave voices. Can also be used as a general-purpose frequency generator."      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "Either tone generator simply takes the input clock frequency, multiplied by 128 and divides it by 8 times the generator's divisor setting."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "It is possible to use the DIP switches to program the generator according to the documentation. Writing 1101 into address 1, 1010 into address 2, 0000 into address 3 and finally 0001 into address 7 will cause a ~440Hz tone to appear on SOUT0."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Two speakers, or a suitable way to combine the audio signals, as well as a microprocessor or microcontroller to program the 1143."      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     6000       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required)
